# KVCLI

[![Test](https://github.com/C-Pro/kvcli/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/C-Pro/kvcli/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A test task to create a CLI based in-memory (no persistence) key value store with nested transactions support.

I assume arguments do not contain spaces, so I can skip proper parsing and resort to strings.Split
